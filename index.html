<h1>WELCOME</h1>
<p><strong>Ever since I was a liitle girl, I always aspired to be something great. I dreamt of being on a big stage with all spotlights on me. My name in big lights was all I ever imagined for myself. Though I never knew how I was going to get to that point. Until I turned 12 years old. Once I turned 12 I was very interested in YouTube and watching college vlogs, makeup tutorials, hair tutorials and room decor. I was fascinated by the lifestyle of having my own business for hair and beauty or planning events for others. Though when I took Psychology Class my senior year of high school, the career of becoming a Psychiatrist swiftly grabbed my attention. The idea of being an actual doctor and having the option of opening up your own practice while helping others mentally and physically was the selling point for me. That is why the top 3 career choices I am interested in are: Psychiatry, Entreprenuership, and Event Planning. </strong></p>
